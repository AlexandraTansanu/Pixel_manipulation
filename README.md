# Pixel_manipulation
Pixel_manipulation exercises demonstrate how the Processing IDE can access the pixels in a canvas and manipulate them. All pixels are stored in the Processing environment in a simple array. However, when the position of a certain pixel becomes relevant, the exercises iterate through the array of pixels using a matrix for simplicity.
