# Pixel manipulation
Part of an exercise in the first academic year, pixel manipulation demonstrates how Photoshop algorithms work. The program is entirely written in Java. 

**Difficulty level:** Beginner. 

**How it was built:** The pixel maipulation exercise simply accesses pixels in a canvas and manipulates them. The canvas is directly proportional with the image that is going to be manipulated. All pixels are stored in the Processing environment in a simple array. However, when the position of a certain pixel becomes relevant, the program iterates over the array of pixels using a matrix for simplicity. 

> This exercise is written and animated using the Processing IDE. More information on inbuilt functions that have been used throughout the code can be found by accessing the [Processing Documentation](https://processing.org/reference/)
